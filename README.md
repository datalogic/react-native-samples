# react-native-samples
Sample react native projects that use the Datalogic [react native module](https://github.com/datalogic/react-native-datalogic-module).  Documentation [available here](https://datalogic.github.io/reactnative/).

## Build

Assuming you have properly set up your [React Native development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and you have [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed, these steps should be enough to get the app up and running on your device:

```bash
cd <sample-project>
yarn
yarn react-native start
<in a separate terminal>
yarn android
```
